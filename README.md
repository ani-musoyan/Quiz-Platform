# Quiz-Platform

Welcome to Our Final Project (Quiz Platform)
This is a quiz platform where users can take a quiz on 4 different topics: Geography, History, Movies, and Sports For each topic, there are 5 quizzes related to that topic, each containing 5 questions. There are 3 types of questions: multiple choice, Yes/No, and fill-in-the-blank (type questions). This is a dynamic blend of multiple classes, inheritance relationships, and polymorphic behavior. With custom exception handling, interface, and integration of database and UI, the platform delivers a smooth and engaging quiz experience.
